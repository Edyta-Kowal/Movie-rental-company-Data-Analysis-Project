# Movie-rental-company-Data-Analysis-Project
This project involves helping Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former movie rental store chain, adapt to competition from streaming services by launching an online video rental service. I used SQL to manage and analyze their data, addressing various business queries from different departments and presenting my findings ultimately acquiring valuable SQL skills applicable across industries.

This project was created as part of the 'Data bases &amp; SQL for Analysts' course in the CareerFoundry Data Analyst program.
